## Local development

Assumes that you are on Mac OS and have Homebrew installedâ€¦

1. Install Hugo, the static site generator `brew install hugo`
1. Clone the code base `git clone https://github.com/madebykind/madebykind-v3`
1. Install all the dependencies `yarn`
1. Build all the things, in memory, and watch all the things `yarn dev`
1. If things ever go pear-shaped `yarn clean` will remove `/node_modules` reinstall everything from scratch and remove the build output directory `/dist/` to leave you with a box-fresh and squeaky clean dev environment.

That's it. Netlify build's everything on Git push. If you need to deploy somewhere else `yarn build` the dist directory is the complete built site.

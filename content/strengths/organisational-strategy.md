We start by understanding why your brief is important and how it supports the overall strategy of your organisation. This not only involves reading strategy documents but also talking directly to key stakeholders about how they are implementing strategy and how our work will help them to do that better. It's this clear view of what matters to the wider organisation that helps us to maintain successful relationships and deliver digital work that is well-received and supported by everyone.

Our next step is to explore the audiences that will be using the finished product.

We do this together, identifying the various audience groups and theorise about their needs and how they want to consume content.

These theories about users are then translated into "user stories" - a short description of what a user wants to achieve and why, written from their point of view, before being validated through user testing and interviews.

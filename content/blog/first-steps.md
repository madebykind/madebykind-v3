intro: In my previous post ​I announced Kind's resolutions for 2017 and we're
  already making progress.

As for our other resolutions, we’ve been working hard on calculating our carbon footprint (the first step towards carbon neutrality) and implemented training and conference budgets for our team.

One of our resolutions was to join the [1% for the planet](http://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/) movement and we’re pleased to announce that we are now fully signed up members.

We’re now looking at which environmental nonprofits to support over the coming year and how we can help in addition to our donations.

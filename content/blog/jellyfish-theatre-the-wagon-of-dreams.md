## About Jellyfish Theatre

London-based Jellyfish Theatre teamed up with local actors Jordan Laidley and Mitchell Ndema to bring an interactive family show 'The Wagon of Dreams' to 10 parks across Nottingham. They managed to secure funding from the Arts Council England and local councillors to create a touring production with the aim to engage with families that do not have frequent access to theatre, in a safe outdoor environment.

## How we helped

Given their ethos and passion for their shows, we were thrilled to help them in whatever way we could. In this instance what they needed was marketing advice on how best to promote their show across the region.

## Research

To make sure we could give the best guidance, we undertook some research to understand the theatre company, regional outlets/press/venues that may be useful to them and how other shows were attempting to 'reopen' the arts during the pandemic.

## Meeting

We spoke at length with Artistic Director Sarah Simpson to understand what they were trying to achieve and what resources they had available to dedicate to the promotion of their show. We were then able to offer ideas in the form of a basic marketing plan to help them reach their goals.

## Social media content planning advice

One of the central ideas we discussed was around how they could utilise their digital platforms to explain the show and to get people to engage and book tickets. We gave the team ideas on different types of content they could create, the frequency and timing of posts, where they could promote it and how they can plan and manage all of this through the use of a content planning document, helping them to use their time effectively and get the best out of their dynamic content and resources.

## Press release guidance

The team wanted to engage the local media in order to reach their target audience and create excitement around the show. We guided them on how to put together a press release in the right format for local media and gave them a list of outlets to reach out to.

They've just completed their shows in Nottingham, we've loved seeing them promoting their work and getting lots of people involved across the city. Now they're taking their tour across the country, check out their [website](https://www.jellyfishtheatre.com/) to see if they are heading towards a park near you! We'd highly recommend it.

Every charity wants the work they do to make an impact, but not every campaign connects with the bigger goals of the organisation. When campaigns are disconnected from your strategy, you may find that time and resources are wasted, messages feel inconsistent, and opportunities to engage your supporters are lost. Aligning your campaigns with your strategy ensures that every effort you make contributes to your mission.

## Understanding your organisational goals

Before planning a campaign, it is important to be clear about what your organisation is trying to achieve. This goes beyond a mission statement. Your goals might include raising awareness, influencing policy, engaging volunteers, or increasing donations. The best way to uncover these objectives is to speak with people across your organisation, run workshops, and review existing strategy documents. At Kind, we often start projects by helping charities clarify these goals. Having a clear picture of your objectives makes it easier to plan campaigns that actually deliver impact.

## Mapping campaigns to strategy

Once you understand your goals, the next step is to consider how each campaign supports them. Every campaign should contribute to at least one of your organisational priorities. For example, a fundraising campaign can also educate your supporters about your cause and strengthen your community engagement. Considering campaigns in this way helps you focus your efforts, keep messages consistent, and make it easier to see what is working.

## Measuring impact

Knowing whether a campaign is making a difference is essential. Setting clear measures allows you to track performance and make adjustments as needed. At Kind, we help charities define what success looks like and review outcomes with them. Measuring impact gives you insight into what works and what does not, so that each campaign can be more effective than the last.

Aligning your campaigns with your organisational strategy is not just about efficiency. It helps you engage your supporters more effectively, use resources wisely, and make sure every activity moves your organisation closer to its mission.

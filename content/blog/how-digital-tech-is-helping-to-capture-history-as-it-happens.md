intro: I am probably not alone in feeling like I am living through a series of
  intense Hollywood blockbusters right now. From the down-right absurdity of
  domestic and international politics, the worldwide protests supporting the
  Black Lives Matter movement through to the apocalyptic climate change-induced
  weather, oh and that teeny tiny global pandemic. For many of us, it really
  feels like we have front-row seats for a period of time that will go down in
  history and be taught to many generations to come.

So with that in mind, and as digital nerds and lovers of arts, culture and museums, we got to thinking about how history is captured in a digital era. I think of history and my school years, learning about the Tudors and Stuarts from massive textbooks and possibly visiting a museum to draw pictures of armour and crowns. It is fair to say, A LOT has moved on since then. Not only has the way we digest history changed (thanks internet) but what we consider to be worth capturing has had to change too. Previously the emphasis on historical collection was on physical pieces (letters, art, literature, clothes and so on) but in the last 20 years, society, how it functions, interacts and engages has become vastly different to pre-2000 and so is what we will identify as artefacts of history.

## **We are all able to capture and share history in real-time**

Most people have access to a device that gives them the ability to use the internet and therefore a whole host of content sharing platforms. Individuals now have the power to not only access live news and unfolding events but to create and become a part of the news too. We can all capture images, video and audio and share them in real-time. So what does this mean for the preservation of 'moments in time' for future generations? Digitally we are able to obtain and give access to a far broader breadth of information than we have ever been able to before, if (as a lot of institutions are) we move quickly and look to retain a variety of different mediums of 'history'. We live in an age of social media, each of these has hundreds of thousands of pieces of user-generated content uploaded daily expressing individual's views on what they are experiencing. This is history being documented as it happens and is arguably a more honest and authentic view of how events are truly unfolding. However this also brings up a significant challenge, with the impermanence and speed of change of the internet and how it is used, how can you collect and retain pieces of history that may disappear the next day? Not to mention navigating through disinformation and 'fake news'!

We already have platforms such as the [internet archive](https://archive.org/web/) and the [UK web archive](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/en/ukwa/index) which document web pages and media from across the years, but what more can be done?

Recently there have been some really good examples of how museums and organisations are seeking to link between the more traditional physical exhibitions and artefacts and tie them together with their digital counterparts.

## **The Coronavirus Pandemic**

The coronavirus pandemic is an example of how many experiences and artefacts are currently being captured and will continue to be as we move through the year. People have gone to digital platforms to share their experiences and connect with other people. A quick search on any hashtag or search engine will show you images, videos, tweets, Instagram posts of how people are surviving the pandemic. It's because of this that some museums have already sought to capture this information for future exhibitions. [The Museum of London recently acquired](https://madeinshoreditch.co.uk/2021/01/29/museum-of-london-acquires-viral-tweets-for-collecting-covid/) a dozen viral tweets which embodied the mood of Londoners during the first lockdown. These tweets formed a part of Twitter UK's ['History in the Tweeting' report](https://marketing.twitter.com/en_gb/collections/history-in-the-tweeting), which looked at how social media was used during this time and how it will shape personal interactions and sharing in the future.

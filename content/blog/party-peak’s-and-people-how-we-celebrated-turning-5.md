Given the importance of a small business reaching a milestone like 5 years in operation, it seemed appropriate to reflect on everything that had happened and to celebrate coming as far as we have. In a recent post, our co-founder Mat shared his view on [​‘5 years of being Kind’](https://madebykind.com/blog/5-years-of-being-kind). Doing ​‘good’, building a team and caring about what you do are the core principles of what makes Kind who we are today. With that in mind, it was only right that we thanked all of those who have helped us on the journey and celebrate with them. 

## Raising a glass

Last week we hosted a party for the people that have supported Kind over the years, This included clients, local businesses, creative peers, our previous interns, and friends and family. Continuing our commitment to supporting local independent businesses we hosted our event at [31K in Hockley](https://bar31k.com/), who supplied us with excellent meatball mezze platters and even more enjoyable cocktails. Many a ​‘highland sling’ and ​‘old-fashioned’ was sampled that night. Thanks to Will and his team for looking after us! We decorated the venue with some amazing plants from [The Watered Garden](https://thewateredgarden.co.uk/) at Sneinton market. And we had absolutely delicious cupcakes and the most elaborate ​‘5’ biscuit we have ever seen from the lovely team at [Strawberry Cupcakes](http://www.strawberrycupcakes.co.uk/). We strongly recommend checking all of those places out. Thanks also to budding photographer Hassan from [185 Photography](https://www.instagram.com/185photography/) for capturing some moments for us.

## Time out with the team

When reflecting on the achievement of 5 years in business it only felt right to celebrate that shared success with the team that has helped to make it happen. Being a group of nature-loving, ​‘outdoors’ types (well most of us…) we ventured out into the Peak District to enjoy some time away from our screens and to recharge as a team in the great outdoors. Having rented a lovely cottage in the village of Foolow, we were in the perfect location to visit a number of beautiful areas and really ​‘stretch’ our legs. We started our day off with an incredibly fun (mildly exhausting) team building game with the wonderful guys at [PeaksGo.](https://www.peaksgo.com/) As a somewhat competitive team, we chose to do the ​‘Hunted’ experience. Much like the TV show but without the helicopters. As we collected tokens for points around the lovely landscape of Hartington we also had to evade capture. This resulted in a lot of running and maybe a little screaming…but overall a great time and got us really working well as a team. Massive thanks to David and Chris for running that session for us.

As if that wasn’t enough of a workout, we then spent the rest of the day exploring Mam Tor, Winnat’s Pass and Curbar Edge.

Our day out in the peaks brought our celebrations to a close, but we continue to draw upon everything we have learnt in the first 5 years and hope to continue our growth and success in the future. Finally, a huge thank you to every person who has supported Kind. We really appreciate it.

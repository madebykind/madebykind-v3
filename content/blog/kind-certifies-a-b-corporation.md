Certified B Corporations, or B Corps, are companies that meet the highest standards of social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability.

{{< youtube GP69PNzOQ1U >}}

In the UK, the B Corp community represents a broad cross section of industries and sizes, comprises over 600 companies, including well-known brands such as The Guardian, innocent, Patagonia, and Abel & Cole.

The certification process was rigorous, requiring us to reach a benchmark score of over 80 while providing evidence of socially and environmentally responsible practices in the areas of Governance, Workers, Community, Environment and Customers. In becoming certified, Kind has legally embedded our commitment to purpose beyond profit into our company articles.

We believe that business is personal and we’ll continue to do everything we can to ensure the impact we are having on the world is a positive one.

We’re excited to get to know other businesses in the B Corp community and see how we can continue improving as a Business for Good.

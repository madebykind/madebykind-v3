I thoroughly enjoyed working with the team from Kind on the open standards for data guidebook. They quickly understood both our needs and the broader goals of the project. The team brought enthusiasm, a range of expertise and a desire to work collaboratively with us that helped us create a fantastic output within tight timescales. I'm looking forward to working with them again in future!

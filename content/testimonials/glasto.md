It was a great pleasure to work with Kind on the Performing Glastonbury database. From beginning to end, they brought a huge amount of passion, creativity and technical expertise to the project. The team helped shape the approach and delivery to ensure we not only met but exceeded expectations, and faced every challenge with open communication and good humour. On top of that, they are a lovely group of people to work with!

  ## Connecting systems for better relationships

  Your CRM holds valuable information about the people your organisation interacts with, from ticket buyers and donors to subscribers and members. By linking this data with your website we can not only keep everything up to date automatically, but build useful and powerful features for your users.

  Features like member registrations and renewals, website content that is tailored to preferences of individual users or the ability to manage a regular donation.

  We regularly work with integrations for systems such as Spektrix, MailChimp and Microsoft Dynamics. These allow organisations to manage their communications and relationships more effectively, with websites and CRMs working together rather than as separate silos.

## They're not for everyone

Integrating a CRM with your website can be complex and expensive, and is most beneficial when organisations need to manage a significant volume of interactions. For a smaller organisation with straightforward needs, the cost and effort may not be justified. But for those handling large audiences and multiple channels of communication, the benefits can be substantial.

  ## What is design system?
  
  ### A single source of design truth

  A design system is a consolidation of an organisation’s visual identity, strategy, brand values, purpose and audiences into shared practices, principles, design patterns, templates, themes and end products such as websites and printed media.

  It acts as the single source of truth for everything a brand will deliver visually, and otherwise. It's a playbook for how a brand and strategy translates into real-world assets.

  It is constantly evolving, a living thing, and as such is never ‘finished’. As an organisation or brand grows, the number of outputs to maintain grows, and the design system grows along with them.

## They're not for everyone

One of the major benefits of implementing a design system is increasing the speed of design and, by extension, reducing the overhead involved in repeating tasks.

Therefore, for smaller organisations and brands with very few design outputs, the benefit of using a design system is often negated by the cost of implementation.

But, organisations with an array of different design outputs, both online and offline, benefit hugely.

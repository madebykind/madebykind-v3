  ## What is a content management system?
  
  ### Putting content in your hands

  Content management is the process of organising and publishing your digital content through a  platform called a Content Management System (CMS). A well-designed CMS allows your teams to make changes confidently, without depending on developers for every small update.

  We use Craft CMS in many of our projects because it offers a flexible, intuitive editing experience and can be easily tailored to the structure of your content, rather than the other way around. Your editors can work quickly and confidently, while the underlying system ensures content is presented consistently across the site.

## Maintaining consistency

Good content management also helps to maintain consistency. By setting clear structures for different content types, everything from articles to events can be created with the right format and presentation. This not only keeps things looking coherent but also makes it easier to reuse content across different parts of a site.

            - We pledge to offset twice our emissions to date
          description: >

            Kind was founded in July 2014 and from day one, we’ve been collecting data on our energy usage, travel and purchases that all contribute to our total greenhouse gas emissions.


            This year, we signed up for the World Land Trust Carbon Balanced programme, which aims to protect biodiversity around the world.


            The programme also gives us access to an emissions calculator tool, which we are using to calculate our footprint for each year of our operation.


            We will complete this work next year and have pledged to offset twice these emissions through the programme and will continue to do this each year in the future.

      key_goals:
        - title: Donate 25% of profits to charity by 2025
          status: Completed
          now:
            - Completed a three-year cycle, donating 28% of profits to charitable causes as cash.
          next:
            - We pledge to continue donating a minimum of 25% of profits as cash
          description: >

            We’re members of 1% for the Planet, which requires us to donate a minimum of 1% of our turnover to environmental non-profits, however, half of that donation can be made ‘in-kind’ through pro-bono work or volunteering.


            Our conversations with charity partners have taught us that cash donations have a much bigger impact than time, so we aim for the majority of our donations to be in cash.

            Last year we donated 0.9% of our revenue as cash, which equated to 24% of our profits.


            Meaning that over the last three financial years, we have donated 28% of our profits as cash to charitable causes.

            So we have begun work on implementing an improved employee development process that includes:


            - Guidance for career and personal development

            - Clearly-identified and achievable goals

            - 360 degree feedback

            - Social and environmental goals

            Kind was certified as having an Impact Business Model, due to working exclusively with purpose-driven organisations.

            We’re for everyone who’s making a change for good, and while we do see many of the positive impacts our work is helping to create, measuring the impact of our work will help us to concentrate our efforts where they are most useful.

  Kind was founded in 2014 as a force for good. At the time, there were a handful of other digital and creative agencies working in the impact space. Unlike Kind, though, a lot of them propped up their income by working with organisations whose values didn’t align with their own.

  A lot has changed since then and over the last year we’ve noticed more of our competitors looking to work with sustainable and ethical clients, some with authenticity and a real desire to do better business, but some just following the latest trend to maximise their profit.

  This has forced us to defend our position, and in turn the position of other truly purpose-driven organisations, such as our fellow B Corps. We’re now in a period of transition as a business, from a friendly, unassuming ‘digital agency with purpose’ to a more assertive and proud agency ‘for the good folks’.

  And we have a lot to be proud of. Such as how our small team continues to punch above it’s weight, helping to create huge impact for causes we truly care about.

  Our ongoing relationship with Rewilding Britain, has allowed us to really see the contribution our work can make to longer-term impacts. Rewilding is now a commonly understood term and many, like ourselves, believe it to be central to the fight against climate change.

  Certifying as a B Corporation was something we had planned to achieve since 2015, but delivering for our clients has always been our primary focus. Finding time to complete the B Impact Assessment always came last.

  When we found time, during the first Covid lockdown, we discovered that the values, processes and structures we already had in place were enough to get us over the 80-point benchmark and, after a year of mostly waiting in the queue we were certified.

  We don’t see our B Corp certification as a checkbox exercise or marketing tool. Instead, we’ve used the assessment process to gather ideas for how we can do even better. Over the past year, we’ve progressed 70% of the improvement goals we set when we were certified, including work on becoming climate positive by 2024 and donating 25% of profits to our charity partners.

  We’re looking forward to seeing our team continue to smash these goals next year.

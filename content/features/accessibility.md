Semantic elements, user-centric design and rigorous testing ensure that we ship accessible sites that adhere to industry best-practice as standard, because we [care about our users](/thoughts-on-accessibility/).

We test all our pages to ensure <abbr class="smcp" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> AA compliance as a minimum, and in most cases we strive for a AAA rating; because there are no downsides to making a site 100% accessible.

See [our accessibility statement](legal/accessibility/) for full details.

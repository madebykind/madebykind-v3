<p>Almost all of our computer hardware is made by Apple, who have been carbon neutral since 2020 and have plans in place for their products to be carbon neutral by 2030. Either way, we still offset any new hardware we purchase, just in case.<br/></p>
<p>Apple are making sustainable changes elsewhere with their product range too, reducing the energy consumption of their products, removing unnecessary accessories such as USB plug sockets and headphones that most people already own.</p>
<p>When we need to replace hardware as it gets old, we do our best to give it to someone who can make further use of it, whether thatâ€™s through sending a laptop for refurbishment or simply by giving a mobile phone to someone who needs it.</p>
<h3>What else can we do?</h3>
<ul><li>Fully research the supply chain for smaller hardware such as mouses and USB Hubs</li></ul>

<p>Everyone needs to eat, but some meals have a bigger negative impact than others. So, when we eat out or drink as a team, we always do 3 things:</p>
<ul><li>We visit local and independent businesses that have a net positive social impact in Nottingham (or wherever our team are at the time). We’re big fans of <a href="https://junkbars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Junkyard</a>, <a href="https://www.jamcafe.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamcafe</a> and <a href="https://thebottletopnotts.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bottle Top</a>, who all play a hugely positive role in the local community, but also cater for our vegetarian and pescatarian team members.</li><li>The company always pays because it shouldn’t cost anyone to feel part of the team.</li><li>We keep track of what people consume, so we can offset the potential negative environmental impact of that consumption.</li></ul><h3>What else can we do?</h3>
<ul><li>Encourage our team to try more vegan and vegetarian alternatives to their meals.</li><li>Encourage our team to eat and drink more local produce.</li></ul>

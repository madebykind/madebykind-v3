title: Carbon and other emissions
---

<p>Kind was founded in July 2014 and from day one, weâ€™ve been collecting data on our energy usage, travel and purchases that all contribute to our total greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Between 2014 and 2018 we offset more than 100% of our emissions through the World Land Trust Carbon Balanced Fund.</p>
<p>Last year, we signed up for the World Land Trust Carbon Balanced programme, which aims to protect biodiversity around the world.</p>
<p>The programme also gives us access to an emissions calculator tool, which we are using to calculate our footprint for 2019 onwards.</p>
<p>We will complete this work in 2024 and have pledged to offset twice these emissions through the programme and will continue to do this each year in the future.</p>

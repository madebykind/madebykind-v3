title: Clients

<p>Since we founded Kind in 2014, we’ve been very selective about who we work with. Our clientbase is 100% made up of organisations that have a net positive impact on society and/or the environment. This includes education providers, environmental charities, arts organisations and healthcare researchers.</p>
<p>When talking to potential new clients, we have a scoring system that uses third-party tools to measure both the positive and negative impacts created by the organisation’s work. We then have a benchmark score that a client must reach before we agree to work with them. Because we have become known for our work in certain sectors, the majority of our potential clients reach this benchmark with ease, but the process led to us turning away a lot of potentially lucrative projects in our formative years. After all, we value <strong>impact above profit</strong>.</p>

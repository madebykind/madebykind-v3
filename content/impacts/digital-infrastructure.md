<p>We store all of our files in the cloud using <a href="https://www.box.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Box</a>. Box’s primary data centre, which our files are stored on, runs on 100% renewable energy and they are in the process of moving the rest of their infrastructure to renewable data centres. Box’s ESG is available online: <a href="https://www.box.com/en-gb/about-us/esg"></a><a href="https://www.box.com/en-gb/about-us/esg">https://www.box.com/en-gb/about-us/esg</a></p>
<p>The websites we build are hosted either through AWS or Digital Ocean, both of whom are renewable datacentres. We also test our work with <a href="http://www.websitecarbon.com/">websitecarbon.com</a> to measure and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of our deliveries. Methods for doing this are set out in <a href="https://madebykind.com/blog/building-a-more-sustainable-website-architecture/">this blog post</a>, but include:</p>
<ul><li>Creating lightweight codebases</li><li>Optimising imagery</li><li>Removing or reducing video use</li><li>Serving static HTML</li><li>Making use of client- and server-side caching</li></ul><h3>What else can we do?</h3>
<ul><li>We also use a number of web services to do our work, including Slack, Adobe Creative Cloud and Trello. The majority of these have sustainability or impact reports. We will review them and see if there are alternatives that are more sustainable.</li></ul>

<p>We are a Living Wage Employer. Although all of our team are paid at least twice the living wage, we decided to register as a Living Wage Employer to ensure that our interns are paid fairly too, even though they donâ€™t contribute to project work.</p>

<p>Our median gender pay gap is 0%, because there's no reason why it shouldn't be. Our full-time equivalent team is 50% female, 50% male, just like our business ownership.</p>

<p>Additional to pay, we give our team:</p>

<ul><li>Hybrid working and flexible hours</li>
<li>Unlimited holiday allowance that we encourage our team to make use of</li>
<li>A team summer trip which includes positive impact activities</li></ul>
<h3>What else can we do?</h3>
<ul><li>Find an ethical medical insurance supplier</li>
<li>Address the current lack of diversity within the team</li></ul>

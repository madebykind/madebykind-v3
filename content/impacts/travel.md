Kind have clients all over the UK but even making a visit by public transport has an affect on the environment.
 
While we aim to carry out at least 90% of our meetings via video conferencing tools, face-to-face meetings can often be beneficial to the projects we’re working on, so there are occasions when we travel to our clients’ offices. 
 
In addition to that, we travel for in-person conferences and events and for our annual team building trip.

To reduce the impact of our travel we:

- Carry out 90% of our meetings via video conferencing
- Travel by train whenever feasible
- Travel together
- Hire an electric or hybrid vehicle when travelling by car
- Offset the greenhouse gas emissions from our travel

## What else we can do

- Find an electric vehicle hire supplier

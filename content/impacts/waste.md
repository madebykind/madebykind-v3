<p>Our waste management policy outlines how we adopt a ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’ approach to waste. It also sets our yearly maximum landfill target (as unfortunately some waste is not recyclable or compostable) at 50kg.</p>
<p>Our office space at Works Social in Nottingham is home to a wormery that is used to compost food waste within the building. So every cup of tea we make can be used to grow plants.</p>

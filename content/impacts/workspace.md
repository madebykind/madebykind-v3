<p>Our team work both from their homes and from our shared workspace in Ruddington. This hybrid approach allows our team to reduce their commuting time and gives them the flexibility to do the school run or carry out personal wellbeing activities, like going for a run or baking bread, during their working day.</p>
<p>Having a shared office space, also gives them the opportunity to get away from the house to interact with their team and other creatives in person, or even if they just want to reduce their energy bill slightly.</p>
<p>We moved into the shared office in Ruddington in May 2023 and are implementing the following sustainability measures:</p>
<ul><li>Running entirely on renewable energy.</li><li>Using environmentally responsible and ethical cleaning products</li><li>Using recycled and zero waste office supplies wherever possible</li><li>A wormery to compost all of our food waste</li><li>Introducing indoor plants</li></ul><h3>What else can we do?</h3>
<ul><li>Explore cycle to work initiatives</li><li>Encourage or incentivise public transport use for commuting</li></ul>

<p>Our team work both from their homes and from our shared workspace at <a href="https://www.workssocial.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Works Social</a>. (2021’s East Midlands “Start-up of the Year”). This hybrid approach allows our team to reduce their commuting time and gives them the flexibility to do the school run or carry out personal wellbeing activities, like going for a run or baking bread, during their working day.</p>
<p>Having a shared office space, also gives them the opportunity to get away from the house to interact with their team and other creatives in person, or even if they just want to reduce their energy bill slightly.</p>
<p>Works Social is a sustainable co-working space in Nottingham’s Lace Market. Sustainability measures they have introduced include:</p>
<ul><li>Run entirely on renewable energy supplied by Bulb</li><li>Sensor activated LED lighting</li><li>Boiling water taps, so we only heat what we use</li><li>Large windows on all walls on the third floor (where Kind are based), means the sun provides the majority of our heating</li><li>Using hypoallergenic, environmentally responsible and ethically sound cleaning products</li><li>Using recycled and zero waste office supplies wherever possible</li><li>A wormery to compost all of our food waste</li></ul><h3>What else can we do?</h3>
<ul><li>Plants have a positive environmental impact, but also improve the wellbeing of our team. We should introduce more into the working environment</li><li>Explore cycle to work initiatives</li><li>Encourage or incentivise public transport use for commuting</li></ul>

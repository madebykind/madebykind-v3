help_intro: "We want to help you achieve your mission in the most effective way possible, so you can keep doing the important work you’re doing and save the bumblebees. Here’s how we can support the Bumblebee Conservation Trust."
help_items:
  - title: Brand strategy & development
    description: A strong brand creates a great foundation for building awareness, helping you stand out and getting people involved in supporting your charity. This will increase brand recognition and encourage people who come across the brand to engage more and want to find out more, leading them along the journey to find out more. We can really build on your existing tone of voice to make the brand more engaging.

      Currently on social media, there are different fonts and styles used on different posts which creates a level of inconsistency and disconnect.


      A strong brand can be applied across all of your touchpoints like your website, social media, downloads (e.g. activity packs) and engaging graphics to share in multiple places (e.g. stats, fun facts etc).
  - title: Clearer user journeys & information architecture
    description: >

      We can help you define your user journeys and make them more obvious for users landing on your website. When it’s clear where a user should go next on every page, this can help you build awareness of your charity and also guide people to support by joining or donating.


      There’s a lot going on in the nav at the moment which can be overwhelming - we can help you to simplify and improve IA to make these user journeys much clearer and send users/potential supporters in the right direction.
  - title: User experience
    description: At Kind, we’re advocates for user-centred design, which means understanding user needs and creating a website that meets these needs as well as your organisation’s goals. Through a discovery phase, we can research and explore your organisation’s goals & objectives and the needs of your users, to ensure a deep understanding and inform the website wireframe and design process, which we will test with users for best results.

      Through this process we can ensure users are able to find the information they’re looking for and make it easier for them to support you.

      
      Then using the information gathered in the discovery phase, we can design a visually engaging, accessible and functional website using your brand.
help_intro_2: With our expertise in brand, strategy and digital, we're confident we can help you build awareness and support in conserving bumblebees and their habitat. Together, we can collaborate to create a more impactful and engaging brand and online presence for the Bumblebee Conservation Trust. Let's work together to ensure that bumblebees not only survive but thrive.

Following a number of, frankly traumatic, experiences with e-commerce extensions for Joomla, I've teamed up with the incredible <a href="https://twitter.com/phproberto" target="_blank">@phproberto</a> to make something better.

Flowcart is a totally new, responsive, fast and standards-based extension that will rock Joomla! e-commerce to the core!

<p>Born out of a desire to scratch my own itch, it was clear that the wider Joomla! world was also desperately in need of something new.</p>
<p>So Flowcart was conceived and the code has begun to flow. As this is a personal project for both Roberto and I, timelines are not exactly set in stone. That said, we definitely expect to have something ready for beta testing in the next month. Stay tuned :) </p>

My project boilerplate; a responsive, mobile-first, HTML5 template for Joomla.

I'll keep this short and sweet, as today is Christmas day and I am enjoying it with my family! I hope you are all doing the same. I want to share my current template starter, what I use to create the leanest, meanest Joomla templates around with anyone who wants it.

## What makes it so awesome?
<ul>
<li>Responsive, scaling from 320px to 1140px</li>
<li>Mobile-first, loading the basics styles first then adding additional pzazz for capable devices</li>
<li>Fluid grid</li>
<li>Responsive image handling</li>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>Mobile friendly optimisations</li>
<li>Smart menu handling for mobile devices</li>
<li>Modernizr, so you can add extra awesome targetting specific device capabilities</li>
<li>Polyfills to make stuff work in crap browsers</li>
<li>Lightweight and fast as hell</li>
<li>Google font goodness baked in</li>
<li>Clean, semantic markup</li>
<li>Plenty of module positions, logically named and laid out</li>
<li>WAI-ARIA Landmark roles</li>
<li>Built according to Vulcan standards of logic</li>
<li>Google Analytics integration</li>
</ul>

## Are you mad?
Possibly. I am also drunk with festive cheer and full of love for my fellow man. The Joomla community has given me so much, this is one way I can give something back.

## Where is it?
You can see a basic demo (I didn't have time to get it all set up) in action at [joomlafuture](https://joomlafuture.com). The code is on GitHub of course, so fork away! [github.com/nternetinspired/OneWeb](https://github.com/nternetinspired/OneWeb)

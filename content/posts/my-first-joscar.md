I had an incredible time at this year's [J & Beyond](https://jandbeyond.org), made even more memorable by the fact I have returned home with a coveted Joomla! Oscar.

While not strictly <em>my</em> J.O.S.C.A.R, but it is most certainly now in my possession, with pride of place on my desk!

Brian Teeman was given a J.O.S.C.A.R in the "best mobile website" category for his newly re-designed [personal site](https://brian.teeman.net), which I had the honor of being asked to create the template for. Nevertheless, I was still more than a little surprised Brian called me onto the stage and graciously handed his award to me.

Not being one to look a gift horse in the mouth, I grabbed the award and scarpered! Thanks Brian!

My [OneWeb](http://joomlafuture.com) template <em>was also nominated</em> in the free extension category, but that award instead went to the very deserving [JCE](http://www.joomlacontenteditor.net) by Ryan Demmer. Congratulations Ryan!

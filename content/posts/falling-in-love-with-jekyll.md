title: Falling in love with Jekyll
categories: [] 
summary: I've now been building websites with Jekyll for a total of two days, and I am already in love. Completely! I’m now at point of wondering if I’ll ever build a site with anything else. It's that good.

I've looked at the [Jekyll website](http://jekyllrb.com/) several times over the past year, after seeing some of the awesome things others had built with it.Each time I left immediately after glancing at the [install documents](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/install) and thinking it was too complicated to be usable. Wow, was I wrong!

It turns out that once you get past the terrifying install instructions, Jekyll is simplicity itself. To my delight I quickly found that Jekyll was almost everything I've ever wanted from a thing-that-makes-websites. Two hours in and I was a complete convert.

## Full control
Using Jekyll you can create the basic layout of your site using just a handful of html and css, throwing in any logic that's needed using [Shopify's](http://www.shopify.com/) wonderful [Liquid syntax](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers). Liquid too came as a revelation to me, it's both incredibly powerful and gloriously simple. I had it doing exactly what I wanted in about 10 minutes.

So, clean html and css, mixed with lean and elegant Liquid. Wonderful. But, it gets better my friends.

### Jekyll eats Markdown
Possibly the best bit about Jekyll is that it allows you to author your posts/pages in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I love html, but I wouldn't want to write a lengthy post with html markup, it's just too many brackets and slashes and too easy to miss something out.

To write a post in Jekyll you simply create a new file with the post date and title in the url, this one for example is 2013-02-20-falling-in-love-with-jekyll.md.

## That’s all folks
Jekyll watches the files in your site and, upon seeing any change, runs through your files and outputs them as a complete static html site. Then Jekyll slinks back into the shadows to watch for further changes.

With your entire site as static html, you no longer require a database, caching mechanisms or PHP(or similar). All of these things were there to 'create some static html from a set of content'. Jekyll just did that in one hit.

I love Jekyll. I implore you, brave the install instructions and give it a try, I think you will love it to.

[Shopify](//www.shopify.com/?ref=internet-inspired) is a hosted e-commerce solution trusted by over 140,000 businesses worldwide. It's experiencing rapid growth, and it isn't hard to see why; Shopify is loved by store owners, shoppers and developers alike.

Having previously worked with a number of other e-commerce solutions including, Prestashop, Magento, Virtuemart, Opencart, RedSHOP and Woocommerce, I remember my first view of Shopify being revelatory. My first reaction on seeing the admin interface for the first time, and I've seen the same reaction on the faces of clients, was total relief.

> An intuitive, and truly user-friendly, interface where everything is where you might expect it and where you instantly feel at home? This is not something traditionally found in e-commerce platforms. This is the real game-changer for me.

In fact, Shopify is actually *enjoyable* to work with. So much so that you might find
yourself harboring an expectation that you will one day find a hidden area where complication, frustration and danger lurk. You won't, because it isn't there. Every aspect of Shopify's offering has been meticulously crafted, and the results of the focus on user experience are undeniable, and it's hard to see how it could be made any better.

## Businesses love Shopify
I honestly believe that Shopify is the easiest **and most cost-effective** way to build an online store and unless you came to me with some very specific, and very unusual, requirements I couldn't, in good conscience, recommend any other e-commerce solution.

> As an experienced Shopify developer I can design and build an easy-to-use, feature-packed and affordable online store that will be a hit with you and your customers. You'll be surprised at just how painless it can be to become successful selling online.

Yes, Shopify charges a [small monthly fee](//www.shopify.com/pricing/?ref=internet-inspired) for their services, but **it is worth every penny**. I've seen many examples of new businesses ploughing tens of thousand of dollars into ‘*free*’ open-source solutions, only to be left with complicated, and fragile, systems that are difficult to use, costly to maintain and are an ongoing drain on resources.

Shopify's paid platform is not only a joy to use and a fantastic fit to the needs of 99% of online retailers, it is also the cheapest solution. No massive upfront costs, a very short
time to deployment and predictable, low, monthly fees all make it a very attractive choice.

### Focus on business building, not system administration
Shopify takes care of all the tedious necessities, and legal obligations, of running a successful online retail business, the things which can steal away time and attention from the business of actually *building your business*. These are the things that no business owner really wants to be responsible for, like;

* **PCI Compliance** - Shopify is level-1 PCI compliant, so you don't need to worry about credit card data security.
* **SSL Certificate** - All Shopify stores includes a 256-bit SSL certificate ensuring customer information and business data is secure.
* **Daily backups** - All business information; products, customers, orders, and inventory, is backed up in secure data centers daily.
* **99.94% uptime and 24/7 monitoring** - Shopify work around the clock to make sure your website is always online.
* **Instant upgrades** - Shopify updates are automatic, so you'll receive the latest features immediately, without any hassle.
* **Unlimited bandwidth** - You'll never be charged based on the number of visitors or traffic to your store.

## I love Shopify!
As a developer I've made the decision that, if my client wants to sell online, I want to work with Shopify. The platform is as enjoyable for developers to work with as it is for store owners to use and, because happy clients are my goal, Shopify is the smartest choice for businesses looking to sell online and the smartest choice for my business.

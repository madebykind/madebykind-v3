Joomla 3.0 brought default web fonts, and notably icon fonts, to the party with the new default template, Protostar.

This is a very welcome move, with icon fonts allowing us to forgo images in many areas but, unfortunately, it also brings a new error;

> Resource interpreted as Font but transferred with MIME type image/svg+xml: http://urhost.com/media/jui/fonts/IcoMoon.svg

If, like me, you are the type of developer who has Developer Tools  constantly enabled you will have already noticed this rather annoying error.
It happens because there are some special requirements to serving webfonts correctly that seem to have been overlooked in the initial Joomla! 3.0 releases. Fortunately, it is incredibly easy to fix.
You already have .htaccess enabled in Joomla! of course (if not, go away and  <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/Enabling_Search_Engine_Friendly_(SEF)_URLs_on_Apache" title="Enabling Search Engine Friendly (SEF) URLs on Apache" target="_blank">enable .htaccess</a> now!) so simply add the following to the file:

	AddType image/svg+xml   	       svg svgz
	AddEncoding gzip                       svgz
	AddType application/vnd.ms-fontobject  eot
	AddType application/x-font-ttf         ttf ttc
	AddType font/opentype                  otf
	AddType application/x-font-woff        woff


Check your console again and you will see the error has gone. Told you it was easy, didn't I?

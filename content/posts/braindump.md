This is a simple list of all the things, related to this project, that I want to get written down quickly somewhere… in case I'm hit by a bus, or timelines and junk.

1. **Fractal should be an output of development**, not a driver of it. It should not be a barrier to development or add friction to the development process. It must bend to fit the process, not dictate the process.

1. **Never design or develop without realistic content**, Lorum Ipsum just does not cut the mustard. Without content we have nothing against which to test our decisions or assumptions and user-generated content is often the biggest unknown. Designing or developing with signifiicant unknown variables is not a recipe for rapidity. Torture-test all assumptions against realistic content.

1. **Content should exist independently** from both design & development and should not be constrained by the expectations of designer or developer (User will _always_ do what you did not expect. You must expect that). A project manager, or a client, should be able to update their content and see those changes refleceted in the design. Content drives design, drives development, drives content. As Yin is to Yang, connected, dependent.

1. **Don’t reinvent the wheel**. Every project has a footer, an index header (hero), a snippet/teaser/card, pagination, site logo, primary navigation, etc. The correct semantic markup (sans opionated styles) for these elements should exist in any project starter and be included in each and every project from the start. Not using a component you don’t need is easy, re-inventing a component from scratch for each project is a massive time-sink and prone to operator error.

1. **Development should be made easier by build processes**, not hindered. Tool chains for development need to be fast and invisible. We should be able to build at the speed we can type, or faster! We didn't get where we are by making flint axes that made it harder, than using your hands, to fell a tree.

1. **The simplest solution _is_ the best solution**. Make users, product managers, clients, designers, developers and bank managers happy by delivering the simplest possible solution to a given problem.  Make everybody happy, use Occam’s Razor.

Joomlafuture is a site showcasing v3 of OneWeb, the lightest, fastest and most advanced responsive template available for Joomla!


<figure><img src="/img/portfolio/joomlafuture.jpg" alt="The fastest, responsive Joomla! template ever made!" /><figcaption>The fastest, responsive Joomla! template ever made!</figcaption></figure>

I created OneWeb to serve as an example of best-practice Joomla templating, a teaching tool that others can learn from and build upon. OneWeb is mobile-first, accessible and built with standards-based html5 and css3. It's totally free, provided under a GPL license.

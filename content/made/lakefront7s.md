Lakefront 7s is an annual seven-a-side rugby tournament hosted by the Milwaukee West Side Harlequins. It is the largest rugby tournament of its kind in the Midwest and attracts over 1500 players. I'm going to write something really awesome here, to explain what the project aimed to achieve,
and how I approached that challenge and what the results were, I just didn't manage to do that before the weekend!

I was very excited when Spiffing Covers approached me to work with them to completely refresh their site. As a publishing house, I knew this would be a site where I could put typography first!

Giving the talented folk at Spiffing Covers a CMS that they could easily work with allowed them to rapidly update content and create stunning magazine-style layouts with ease.

I'm going to write something really awesome here, to explain what the project aimed to achieve,
and how I approached that challenge and what the results were, I just didn't manage to do that before the weekend!

title: Winchester White
summary: I was commissioned by Starberry, an award-winning digital agency specialising in estate agents sites, to implement their designs using Joomla. I delivered a fast, responsive and UX-driven site for their client.

I was asked to implement this design as a Joomla template. I created a new templating system! I'm going to write something really awesome here, to explain what the project aimed to achieve,
and how I approached that challenge and what the results were, I just didn't manage to do that before the weekend!

Joomla! superstar, Brian Teeman, asked me to build the template for his personal blog site. The result was one of the first responsive Joomla templates to focus on speed and simplicity.

This design used only core components, with a mobile-first architecture and a focus on content. The result was a substantial increase in performance and a great improvement in user experience.

Brian was awarded a J.O.S.C.A.R. at JAB12 with this site being awarded "Best Mobile Website".

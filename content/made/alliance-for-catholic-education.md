The University of Notre Dame’s Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE) mission is to help Catholic schools bring the gift of an excellent Catholic education to all children, especially those from low-income families.


ACE is one of the university’s most far-reaching enterprises, present in hundreds of schools, dozens of U.S. Catholic dioceses, and several foreign countries.

Monaco's only radio station, Radio Monaco, decided to move from their existing, 100% Flash-based, website to a minimal responsive design built with Joomla.

Custom-built extensions were used to populate the site with shows in their own podcast format from a remote server and integrate media from their Instagram and Twitter feeds.

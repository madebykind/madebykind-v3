We respect the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and this policy explains how we collect and treat any information you give us. You won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text.

## Our comittment

We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal and business information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies, governments, and other organisations keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers. We’ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.

## How we collect information

We ask for contact information including your name, email address, and phone number, on our website so that we can reply to your enquiry.

Our website doesn’t use cookies or scripts that were designed to track the websites you visit. We don’t use analytics or native social media ‘like’ or ‘sharing’ buttons which also build profiles of your internet activity.

We collect your email address when you sign up for one of our newsletters.

## What information we hold

When you contact us by email or through our website, we collect your name, email address, phone number, a social media username, and the company you work for, if you’ve given us that.
If you sign up for a newsletter, we only collect your email address.

If you do business with us, we also collect your business name and bank details and keep records of the invoices we send you and the payments you make.

## Where we store your information

When you contact us by email or through our website, we may store your your information in our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. If you sign up for a newsletter, we store your email address in Mailchimp, which is the marketing platform we prefer.

## What we use your information for

We occasionally use your contact information to send you details of our services. When we do, you have the option to unsubscribe from these communications and we won’t send them to you again. We might also email or phone you about our services, but if you tell us not to, we won’t get in touch again.

## Who’s responsible for your information at our company

[Contact Name], our Data Controller, is responsible for the security of your information. You can contact them by email at <a href="mailto:help@example.com ">help@example.com</a> if you have any concerns about the information we store.

## Who has access to information about you

When we store information in our own systems, only the people who need it have access. Our management team have access to everything you’ve provided, but individual employees have access to only what they need to do their job.

## The steps we take to keep your information private

Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict access only to people who need it. We store passwords in an encrypted password manager, use a different, randomly generated password for each service, and never use the same password twice.

The computers we use are all encrypted using military-grade encryption and are protected by a passcode or fingerprint access. These computers ask for authentication whenever they’re started or after 5 minutes of inactivity. Our mobile devices are also protected by a fingerprint or facial recognition.

## How to complain

We take complaints very seriously. If you’ve any reason to complain about the ways we handle your privacy, please contact [Contact Name] by email at <a href="mailto:help@example.com ">help@example.com</a>. If you’re the letter writing type, send your envelope to [Contact Address]

## Changes to this policy

If we change the contents of this policy, those changes will become effective the moment we publish them on our website.

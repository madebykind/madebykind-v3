We’re firm believers in transparency when it comes to how we store and use personal data. Here’s our (very short) privacy policy.

## Measurement

We don’t use Google Analytics or any other in-depth analytics tool that captures personally identifying data on this website. Instead we use [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/), which lets us see how our website is being used without being invasive.

## Cookies

Our website uses one cookie, which is set by Cloudflare and is called `_cfduid`. It is used to check whether you’re a bad egg and likely to try to hack or take down our website. It doesn’t track you in any way or store any of your personal details. More information can be found here: [Privacy and the _cfduid cookie](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/reference/cloudflare-cookies/#12345682)

## Mailing list

If you decide to sign up to our mailing list, we’ll send you an email to confirm this before your data is added.

Your data will be processed by Kind and Campaign Monitor for the purposes of sending you updates. We will send a maximum of 6 updates per year.

You’ll have the option to unsubscribe when receiving these emails, but if you’d like to do so at any time you can email [removemydata@madebykind.com](mailto:removemydata@madebykind.com) and we will delete your data within 2 working days.

Every 12 months we’ll ask you to confirm your subscription. If you don’t confirm, we will remove all your data and you will need to subscribe again if you want to receive anything more. 


## How to complain

We take complaints very seriously. If you’ve any reason to complain about the ways we handle your privacy, please contact [Mat Hayward] by email at <a href="mailto:mat@madebykind.com ">madebykind.com</a>.

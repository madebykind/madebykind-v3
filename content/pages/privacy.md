We’re firm believers in transparency when it comes to how we store and use personal data. Here’s our (very short) privacy policy.

## Measurement

We don’t use Google Analytics or any other in-depth analytics tool that captures personally identifying data on this website. Instead we use [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/), which lets us see how our website is being used without being invasive.

## Cookies

Our website uses one cookie, which is set by Cloudflare and is called `_cfduid`. It is used to check whether you’re a bad egg and likely to try to hack or take down our website. It doesn’t track you in any way or store any of your personal details. More information can be found here: [Privacy and the _cfduid cookie](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/reference/cloudflare-cookies/#12345682)

## How to complain

We take complaints very seriously. If you’ve any reason to complain about the ways we handle your privacy, please contact [Mat Hayward] by email at <a href="mailto:mat@madebykind.com ">madebykind.com</a>.

## Changes to this policy

If we change the contents of this policy, those changes will become effective the moment we publish them on our website.

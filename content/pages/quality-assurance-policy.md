Future Friendly Ltd (“The company”) is wholly committed to our quality policy which is in place to ensure our services fully meet the requirements of our customers at all times. The company’s goal is to be the go-to digital agency for socially responsible organisations. To achieve this goal we are committed to implementing, maintaining and continually assessing operational systems and processes.

## Approach to Quality

The company firmly believes in working together with our clients in pursuing this policy and in continually striving for improvements in service quality.

The Quality Policy is based on 3 fundamental principles:

1. Ensuring that we fully identify and conform to the needs of our customers.
2. Looking at our processes, identifying the potential for errors and taking the necessary actions to eliminate them.
3. Everyone at the company understanding how to do their job and doing it right first time.

Our current QA procedures for each area of operation are set out in the company handbook.

To ensure that the policy is successfully implemented, staff are responsible for identifying customer requirements, and ensuring that the correct procedures are followed to meet those requirements.

Objectives needed to ensure that the requirements of this policy are met and that continual improvement is maintained in line with the spirit of the policy, will be set, determined and monitored at Management Review.

## Communication

The Quality Policy principles and objectives will be communicated and available to staff at all times. Training will be an integral part of the strategy to achieve the objectives. The Policy will also be available to clients and candidates upon request.

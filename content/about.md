> As a result, I'm the person in my family who fixes computers, phones and recovers accidentally deleted photos.

* I began building websites for fun in 2002, and for profit in 2006—before starting my own web development business in 2009.
* I'm passionate about good typography and web standards. There are rules for a reason!
* I married the girl I met at university, the ying to my yang, and created three fantastic kids with her—each born in a different country!
* I've lived in four different countries and own every type of cable ever invented.
* I worship a sun god, love camping with friends and family and prefer my food barbequed or pickled.
* I only drink water if it’s carbonated and am allergic to badger milk and swan meat.

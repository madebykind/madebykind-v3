help_intro: We partner with charities and non-profit organisations, helping them to create positive impacts and further their cause through digital strategies and online activities.
help_items:
  - title: Engaging your community
    description: Unsure how digital deliveries can help to achieve your objectives? What your audiences want to see online? Or what it might cost to deliver these? A discovery phase project will allow you to explore your options, gather insight and obtain clarity before moving forward.
  - title: Raise awareness of your cause
    description: In the busy landscape of organisations trying to embed real change, it can be difficult to clearly communicate the challenge being faced whilst engaging others to support the issues and take action. Simplifying content and creating clear user journeys help to clarify your work and gain backing from target audiences.
  - title: Increase support and donations
    description: Whether through public fundraising or grant applications, in many cases none of the work you do can happen without securing funding or public support/donations.
  - title: Strategic consultancy
    description: A strategic approach should be central to every project because, if your project is not meeting organisational goals, it is not worth doing. Taking time to understand your objectives, audiences and opportunities will help to plan and deliver a highly effective end product.

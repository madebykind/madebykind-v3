help_intro: We partner with universities and further education institutions, helping them to communicate their diverse offering to all of their audiences through digital strategies and online activities.
help_items:
  - title: Explore and understand
    description: Unsure how digital deliveries can help to achieve your objectives? What your audiences want to see online? Or what it might cost to deliver these? A discovery phase project will allow you to explore your options, gather insight and obtain clarity before moving forward.
  - title: Put your strategy first
    description: A strategic approach should be central to every project because, if your project is not meeting organisational goals, it is not worth doing. Taking time to understand your objectives, audiences and opportunities will help to plan and deliver a highly effective end product.
  - title: Understand your audience
    description: Nobody should be more important to your organisation than your audience. Our process endeavours to align the goals of your audience members with the objectives of your organisation.
  - title: Increase efficiency with a design system
    description: Complex organisations, like further and higher education providers, can benefit hugely from the introduction of a design system to manage how the look and behave online.

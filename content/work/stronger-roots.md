  ## Brand strategy

  Stronger Roots (Inclusive Recovery Cities) set out to empower Lived Experience Recovery Organisations (LEROs) and make recovery visible in everyday life, tackling stigma and inequality along the way.

  We brought this mission to life by shaping a brand that connects communities, inspires collaboration, and champions fairer opportunities. Workshops with people with lived experience and organisational representatives provided live feedback that directly informed strategy, messaging, and design, ensuring the brand remained authentic, inclusive, and community-rooted.

  ## Visual identity

  Stronger Roots embraced a new name, voice, and visual identity to celebrate growth, resilience, and local connection. Inspired by Nottingham’s forests and the mighty oak, the brand evokes roots growing deeper, strengthening ties, and supporting growth.

  A vibrant Neon Mint palette, handcrafted wordmark, and root-inspired typography bring energy and visual interest, while a ‘rooted’ logo and conceptual root icon reinforce connection. A suite of icons guides users through the brand’s offerings, keeping it approachable, rooted, and memorable.

  ## Marketing strategy

  We developed a practical, future-focused marketing strategy to unite volunteers, partners and local communities around a shared mission. As strategy is designed to be comprehensive, easy to follow and flexible, providing clear options for delivering the work effectively. It sets out a clear path to making the most of limited resources through authentic storytelling on social media, community-led events and local partnerships. By combining digital outreach with on-the-ground engagement, it aims to raise awareness, inspire participation and create lasting impact within the community.

  ## Content strategy and planning

  To bring Stronger Roots’ mission to life across all channels, we created a content strategy built around clarity and connection. It includes  clear key messages, PR hooks and suggested media content, headlines, and a social media content plan with a calendar for consistent, engaging posts. We also developed guidance for managing social media groups and community pages, helping the team nurture supportive, self-sustaining spaces where recovery stories can be shared and celebrated.

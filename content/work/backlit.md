  ## Online brand development

  Backlit is located in an old Victorian textile factory and the existing logo reflected the ‘flying-wheel’ machines that were used in the building a century before Backlit was founded. We built on this nod to the building throughout the Backlit identity, devising brand assets based on the shape of the large windows in the gallery space.

  ## User-centred website

  Backlit required an artistic design to reflect their personality, their historical building, the programme and their commitment to community engagement, ensuring their message of a safe-space for all translates to their audience.

  ## Income generation opportunities

  Backlit is more than a gallery and is home to local artists to develop their skills. They hire out event space and sell studio memberships to enable them to fund the gallery. This was important to make clear on the new site to help them continue to run the organisation and guarantee the funding they need.

  ## Historic archive

  Backlit and Kind have an established partnership. Before their website redesign project, we worked collaboratively to build the Samuel Morley Archive, an interactive and immersive online exhibition.

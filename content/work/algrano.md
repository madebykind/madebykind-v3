  ## Bringing a brand to life online

  Using Algrano's recently refreshed brand identity, we created an impactful, interactive, and engaging online presence, by capturing their values, mission, and vision through compelling stories and consistent visuals, ensuring their brand will continue to set them apart and make a strong impression.

  ## Clear, concise messaging

  Algrano’s brand personality is to be direct, open and friendly. We embraced their changemaker attitude and used straightforward language for their video and website content, making their message engaging and easy to remember, and building trust with potential service users. With a clear balance for both roasters and growers – we focused on showing the relationships that are encouraged, built and nurtured by the Algrano platform. 

  ## Visual storytelling

  To capture attention and maintain engagement we developed an energetic brand explainer video. We created the video to be repurposable, creating multiple short edits that maximised the clients budget and allowed them to use video content across web, social media, presentations and events.

  ## Clear, concise messaging

  Algrano’s brand personality is to be direct, open and friendly. We embraced their changemaker attitude and used straightforward language for the animations and website, making their message engaging and easy to remember, and building trust with potential service users. With a clear balance for both roasters and growers – we focused on showing the relationships that are encourage, built and nurtured. 

  ## Visual storytelling

  To capture attention and maintain engagement we developed an energetic brand explainer video, ensuring to capture key nuggets of information that can be used as short edits We created the video to be repurposable, creating multiple short edits maximising budget so it can used across the web, social media, presentations, and events.

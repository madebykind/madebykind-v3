heading: A user-centred website to build awareness and gain public support
intro: >

    The Rivers Trust aims to bring together the people, knowledge, data and intelligence to help rivers thrive again; for us and future generations.

    By raising awareness of the poor state of rivers in the UK, they rally the public against the lack of policies on keeping Britain’s water healthy and sewage free.
why:
  text: Healthy rivers can play a huge part in reducing the effects of climate change, like flooding and drought. The UK's rivers are some of the unhealthiest in the world.
  person: mat
impact:
  text: After the website launch, the Rivers Trust gained a significant amount of interest in its ‘State of the Rivers’ report, sewage map, and website which led to coverage on national TV and press.

Rivers shape our landscapes and provide the foundations of our cities, towns and countryside. When they thrive, so do we.

  ## Digital brand implementation

  We took the Rivers Trust existing brand and worked to expand it into a format that would translate dynamically online.

  Through a user-centred approach, we reviewed their organisational goals and took the time to understand the needs of both current and target users. We then built a website, tested with real users from key audience groups to ensure it met their needs.

  ## Member portal

  The Rivers Trust is an umbrella organisation for the 65 local trusts working on the ground around the UK. The website needed to explore the breadth of the networks and offer an area for those member trusts to promote news, events, and job vacancies.

  ## Encouraging action

  The issue of sewage and pollution in our rivers has become an emotive subject with the British public. To capitalise on this, we designed an "Email Your Representative" feature, pulling data from UK, Ireland and devolved parliaments and encouraging voters to use their voice.

  ## Layered content strategy

  The website needed to showcase content which was layered for multiple audiences, from top line messaging through to detailed reports. Through thoughtful design and creation of digestible content, such as a sewage map showing overflows of raw sewage in the UK, we helped the Rivers Trust clearly articulate the huge challenge and threat to UK waters.

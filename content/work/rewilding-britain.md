  ## Design system

  As a growing and agile charity, Rewilding Britain from time-to-time will need to change their strategic focus to better reflect the consensus on rewilding in the UK at the time. By delivering a component-based design system, our team reduced the design and development overhead of realising these changes in direction on the Rewilding Britain website.

  ## Content strategy

  With an abundance of resources and content, it was important to deliver a content structure that allowed for ease of navigation and discovery, while providing clarity and inciting action.

  Our team delivered and tested content wireframes for key journeys before producing templates that were structured for readability as well as adding visual interest through great imagery and differing content types, from stat-based infographics, through to video, blogs and clear calls to action.

  ## Network strategy

  Since 2015, Rewilding Britain have been building a network of rewilding projects and local organisations, offering expert advice and enabing action. To aid this work, we created a ‘Networks’ area where Rewilding Britain can share guidance and information on member-only events that helps rewilding projects to prosper. To date over 900 rewilding projects have been supported.

intro: >
  Artswork is a charity that empowers young people through creativity, so they can build a better future – for themselves and others. They believe that if young people dream of changing their lives, or other people’s lives, for the better, they shouldn’t be restricted by their backgrounds or circumstances.

  ## “Creativity for change”

  In a crowded landscape, Artswork needed to stand out as a charity truly championing young people to use creative thinking, feeling, and doing to have a greater impact and to help guide them to a future they can be happy in. To do this they needed to modernise their brand and digital presence to reflect their mission, engage with their audiences, and to create a website that clearly articulated their programmes and impact, encouraging audiences to get involved.

  ## Digital rebrand

  We gave Artswork’s logo a fresh, vibrant update and used bold colours and energetic visuals to reflect the creativity at the heart of their mission. The new look immediately captured the spirit of the charity and the young people they work with, making it more engaging for visitors.

  ## Key messaging

  We worked collaboratively with Artswork to refine their message, making it clear, inspiring, and emotionally resonant. We simplified the messaging with multiple core, clear phrases and supporting details that spoke directly to young people and supporters telling a compelling story of impact and opportunity.

We wanted to work with an agency that could truly understand the complexities of our youth arts charity and the many people we need to reach with our work. The website Kind have created encapsulates what we’re all about – creativity.

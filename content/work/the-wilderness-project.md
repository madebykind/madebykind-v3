  ## Brand strategy

  A brand strategy that honours original storytellers and their discoveries. Subtle brand refinements and a distinct visual language bring depth and motion, guiding the audience through an inspiring journey. Every design choice; from colour and typography to UX, works to inspire, engage, and communicate urgency with clarity and purpose.

  ## Visual identity

  We refined the existing logo and developed an illustration style inspired by expedition scientists’ pen-and-paper field sketches. Expressive, hand-drawn elements guide attention and build visual rhythm, echoing how people highlight key details. The refreshed palette reflects Africa's varied landscapes.

  The identity immerses audiences in the expeditions, offering a glimpse into scientists’ daily experiences and the waterways they explore, while conveying urgency and momentum in the mission.

  ## Website delivery

  We designed an engaging, visually beautiful website that highlights both the scientific expertise behind The Wilderness Project’s fieldwork and the human stories connected to Africa’s core river basins. The clean, responsive platform showcases reports, videos, imagery, and project updates, making their important work accessible, shareable, and impactful on a global scale. With a small but highly active team often working in remote locations, the site was built to be easy to manage and update, ensuring they can keep the world informed, even while out on expedition.

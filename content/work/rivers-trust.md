One of the key goals for Rewilding Britain is to incite action and participation. This meant that key goals for the website would be to drive engagement on all levels and increase support for rewilding in the UK, the Rewilding Network they are building and to encourage physical and financial support.

Through user needs testing, UX, and UI design we were able to develop a website that gave very different groups access to all of the information they needed to support and engage with the cause. Resulting in an increase of xxx donations

Rewilding Britain needed to build a strong network of rewilding projects and local organisations. To enable them to start conversations with these audiences, we created a ‘Networks’ area to enable information to be easily shared and for projects to prosper. xxxx amount of projects have signed up to this.

Partnership - Rewilding Britain understood that they needed a digital partner to not only create a digital presence but to maintain it and evolve as their organisation does. We’ve been delighted to work with them for almost three years to constantly improve the performance and direction of their site as they continue to gain awareness and support on a national and international level.

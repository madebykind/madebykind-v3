## Engaging new audiences

Garden Organic had built a new offline brand and they worked with us to bring that to life digitally, attracting new and varied demographics and making the site even more appealing to audiences who were new to organic gardening.

## Communicating to broad demographics and being inclusive

The new site needed to distill a lot of complex information in a way that was suitable for all ages, experiences, and digital literacy levels. It had to be easy to navigate and to find expert advice on growing the organic way.

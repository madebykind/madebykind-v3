preheading: Branding for charity supporting Nottingham's youth since 1993.
intro: >
  Nottingham is the worst place in the UK to be young, with 17,500 children living in poverty and the crisis worsening due to rising living costs and council funding cuts.


  Base 51 supports over 1,000 young people annually, providing safe, inclusive spaces with access to counselling, trauma support, and youth clubs – including for LGBTQIA+ and refugee communities. Their academy also offers accredited training in counselling and youth work.
why:
  text: Charities like BASE 51 are incredibly important. Young people living in areas of poverty are often overlooked and, without help, could be at risk of serious issues like substance abuse, lack of education, homelessness, and mental health struggles.

  ## Rebranding a 30 year old youth charity

  With national funding cuts and increasing competition for support, it is essential that Base 51 remained visible and relevant to young people. A fresh visual identity was key to maintaining engagement, ensuring their brand continues to connect with those who need them most.

  ## Research and engagement

  A discovery phase brought together young people, staff, stakeholders and volunteers through workshops and focus groups. This process helped uncover their needs, perceptions, and how Base 51 could better communicate its impact.

  ## Brand audit

  An in-depth review of Base 51’s existing identity highlighted opportunities to create a more engaging, cohesive brand presence. The goal was to refine their logo, colours, online platforms, and messaging to better reflect their energy and purpose.

  ## Defining a new brand identity

  The refreshed identity repositions Base 51 as a modern, inclusive, and trusted organisation that empowers young people while delivering high-quality training for future counsellors. It embodies:

  ## Modernising the visuals

  The refreshed branding introduces a bold, purposefully imperfect logo, representing movement, inclusivity, and progression. A vibrant colour palette speaks to their core 11-25 age group, balancing youthful energy with professional tones for their academy. We included gradients to bring fluidity and symbolise growth.

  To enhance clarity, custom ‘stickers’ were designed to define each service area. These elements introduce hierarchy and structure, helping young people quickly identify the support available to them.

  ## Revamping Social Media

  A core part of the project has been to strengthen Base 51's connection with young people. Their social media presence has been revitalised with dynamic visuals, engaging content, and a cohesive aesthetic. The focus was on enhancing existing content, making it instantly recognisable and compelling on digital platforms.

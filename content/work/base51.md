  Nottingham is the WORST place to be a young person (Youth Opportunities Index 2018) with 17,500 children living in poverty which is only getting worse due to the cost of living crisis and recent council funding cuts. Supporting over 1000 young people a year, Base 51 seeks to provide safe, inclusive, and supportive spaces that offer young people access to counselling, specialist trauma support, and youth clubs including groups specifically for LGBTQIA+ and refugees. Through their academy, they provide accredited training in counselling and youth work.

  ## Rebranding a 30 year old youth charity

  Base51 have been running in Nottingham city for over 30 years and have helped thousands of young people during that time. However, in recent times, they have found it harder to secure funding and support from the government and businesses due to national cuts. It is critical, that they are able to stand out in the crowded charity space, as a progressive and important charity in 2025, and secure funding for their vital services for young people in the city and beyond. 

  The rebranding of BASE51 was approached with careful research, strategy, and input from key stakeholders, including young people who were beneficiaries of the charity. Here’s an outline of the process.

  ## Research and engagement

  We ran a workshop with BASE51 which incorporated a focus group with young people to understand their needs, interests, and perceptions of the charity. Additionally, insight from staff and volunteers helped identify the charity's strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.

  ## Defining a new brand identity

  The new brand identity focused on repositioning Base51 as a modern, inclusive, deeply caring and trusted organisation that empowers young people and provides high quality training services for future counsellors. The brand embodies:

  - **Inclusivity**: Ensuring that the charity was seen as accessible and welcoming for all young people, regardless of background.
  - **Empowerment**: Highlighting how Base51 helps young people get support and take charge of their futures.
  - **Community**: Fostering a sense of belonging, togetherness, and local pride among the youth in Nottingham.
  - **Trust:** Base51 offers a non-judgemental safe space for young people to feel seen, heard and supported.
  - **Professional support**: Whether that be the support the young people have access to or the professional training academy

  ## Modernising the visuals

  A new logo was created to be contemporary, bold, and easily recognisable. It incorporated elements that conveyed a sense of flexibility, movement and growth, symbolising the charity’s mission of helping young people progress. A new colour palette was chosen to be vibrant and energetic, appealing to the core audience of 11-25 year olds, whilst maintaining a professional feel.

  ## Social media revamp

  The charity’s social media presence was refreshed with vibrant branding, including new visuals, imagery and content that represented and resonated better with young people. Focussing on elevating the content the team was already creating into a more consistent look and feel that would really make Base51 stand out on the timeline.

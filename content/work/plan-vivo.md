  ## Discovery and planning

  We worked closely with Plan Vivo to understand their audiences, priorities and long-term ambitions. Through collaborative research and workshops, we clarified how their values and community-led approach could be communicated more clearly to members and partners. This phase established a shared narrative that shaped the work that followed.

  ## Brand creation and identity

  The new brand identity reflects Plan Vivo’s integrity and experience, grounded in their community-led approach. The brand brings clarity and confidence to their work, helping them communicate their impact with warmth and authority. The identity creates consistency across channels while clearly distinguishing Plan Vivo from others operating in carbon and climate markets.

  ## Digital accelerator hub

  To support Plan Vivo’s global membership, we created a digital accelerator hub that brings courses and resources together in one accessible place. The hub helps cohort members strengthen their projects and grow collective impact over time.

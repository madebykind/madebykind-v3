  ## Engaging new audiences

  Garden Organic's new offline brand was created to attract new audiences to organic gardening. Our team brought this to life digitally, integrating illustrative assets and the 'human-touch' the identity delivered.

  To further engage these new demographics, we devised a digital content strategy that distilled the abundance of knowledge and varying degrees of complex information into a website that is suitable for all ages, experiences, and digital literacy levels, making it easy to navigate and find expert advice on growing the organic way.

  ## Ecommerce and CRM integration

  We integrated the Garden Organic website directly with Opayo and their third-party CRM to handle online transactions such as donations and membership registrations, as well as taking orders from members of the Heritage Seed Library.

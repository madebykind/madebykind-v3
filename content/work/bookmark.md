intro: 1 in 4 Children in England cannot read well when they leave primary school. Children unable to read well will face difficulties for the rest of school and beyond, devastatingly impacting their life chances. This results in 7.1 million adults in England who struggle to read and face challenges every day – at home, on the move, in the workplace, and with their friends and families.

  ## Creating clear user journeys

  Previously, Bookmark’s content was overwhelming and hard to find. We mapped user needs, and tested IA and wireframes with real users to create targeted journeys for volunteers, donors, schools, and corporate partners. By understanding their motivations, we tailored each journey to highlight impactful involvement opportunities, showcase donor contributions, and present benefits of being involved. This well-defined approach resulted in a seamless and engaging user experience.

  ## Helping Bookmark to stand out

  We helped Bookmark to stand out by amplifying its unique position and impact. By digitally elevating their brand identity and creating a space for them to articulate their stories we’re able to help them build credibility and trust, which is vital to a newer charity.

  ## A simple user-friendly, help centre

  We recognised that a chatbot didn’t fully meet the user’s needs, so we designed a user-friendly help centre with clear categories, concise language, and an intuitive search function. Including FAQs and multimedia resources like video tutorials made information easily accessible. Curated content and internal feedback loops ensured the help center was relevant and based on previous enquiries, aiming to improve user satisfaction and reduce support requests.

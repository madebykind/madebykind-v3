  ## Understanding user needs

  We began with a discovery workshop to understand Izele’s diverse audience, which ranges from grassroots community projects to large conservation areas. Using our user-centred design approach, our team explored goals, challenges, and digital behaviours. These insights informed recommendations for new features and design priorities, improving the user experience for all users and ensuring our work aligned with real conservation needs.

  ## Designing journeys and templates

  Wireframes and interactive prototypes mapped key user journeys across mobile and desktop. This allowed us to test and refine how different user groups would interact with the platform and connect with the wider network. The resulting templates adopt best practices in environmental web design, accessibility, and user experience while still being tailored to the needs of Izele’s users.

  ## A bold new visual direction

  The refreshed design language builds on the Izele logo colours, adding new tones for warmth and vibrancy. Stronger typography and consistent style elements create a professional yet approachable look. The updated visual identity reflects Izele’s ambition, supports clear navigation and readability, and ensures the platform feels welcoming to everyone from local project coordinators to larger conservation organisations.

  ## Building a design system

  A component-based design system provides Izele’s in-house team with reusable elements to maintain a consistent, scalable platform. It reduces duplication, speeds up development, and ensures updates follow user-centred design principles. By embedding these patterns, the platform can grow without losing cohesion, and new templates or features maintain the same clarity and visual style.
